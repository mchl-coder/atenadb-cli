# Atena CLI

![Atena CLI](Atena.png "Atena Logo")

### The official CLI of Atena DB.

Atena-CLI is the Atena command line interface. It allows to send commands and queries to Atena and read the replies sent by the server, directly from the terminal.
Thanks to Atena-CLI you will be able to manage and easily use your Atena installation. We reccomend spending some times to familiarize with it in order to work more effectivly with Atena once you know all the tricks of its command line interface.

Atena has a number of commands and sometimes, as you test things, you may not remember the exact command. Atena-CLI provides help for commands use, using the `help` command.
